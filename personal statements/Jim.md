# Jim's Personal Statement

---

**NB:** Each individual's **personal statement** explaining what they contributed, reflection about what you have learned in this project, mistakes you made, special design decisons, and what you might do differently if you were to do it again or have more time.  This statement must be succinct and to the point, yet must include sufficient details for me to check against the push history of the repo so that any claims can be verified. Including links to a selection of specific commits which demonstrate your work is advised. If you work with another member of your group on a module, make sure to give them [co-author credit](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/creating-a-commit-with-multiple-authors#creating-co-authored-commits-on-the-command-line).
